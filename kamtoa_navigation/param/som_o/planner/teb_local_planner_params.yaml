  # # Overwrite orientation of local subgoals provided by the global planner (since they often provide only a 2D path)
  # global_plan_overwrite_orientation: true
  # # If positive, via-points are extrected from the global plan (path-following mode). The value determines the resolution of the reference path (min. separation between each two consecutive via-points along the global plan, if negative: disabled). Refer to parameter weight_via_point for adjusting the intensity. New in version 0.4
  # global_plan_viapoint_sep: -0.1

  # allow_init_with_backwards_motion: false

  # # If true, the planner uses the exact arc length in velocity, acceleration and turning rate computations (-> increased cpu time), otherwise the Euclidean approximation is used.

  # # Obstacle Parameters
  # # Minimum desired separation from obstacles in meters
  # min_obstacle_dist: 0.5
  # # Specify if obstacles of the local costmap should be taken into account. Each cell that is marked as obstacle is considered as a point-obstacle. Therefore do not choose a very small resolution of the costmap since it increases computation time. In future releases this circumstance is going to be addressed as well as providing an additional api for dynamic obstacles.

  # costmap_obstacles_behind_robot_dist: 1.0
  # # Each obstacle position is attached to the closest pose on the trajectory in order to keep a distance. Additional neighbors can be taken into account as well. Note, this parameter might be removed in future versions, since the the obstacle association strategy has been modified in kinetic+. Refer to the parameter description of legacy_obstacle_association.
  # obstacle_poses_affected: 30
  # # Buffer zone around obstacles with non-zero penalty costs (should be larger than min_obstacle_dist in order to take effect). Also refer to the weight weight_inflation.

  # # The strategy of connecting trajectory poses with obstacles for optimization has been modified (see changelog). You can switch to the old/previous strategy by setting this parameter to true. Old strategy: for each obstacle, find the nearest TEB pose; new strategy: for each teb pose, find only "relevant" obstacles.
  # legacy_obstacle_association: false
  # # The non-legacy obstacle association strategy tries to connect only relevant obstacles with the discretized trajectory during optimization. But all obstacles within a specifed distance are forced to be included (as a multiple of min_obstacle_dist). E.g. choose 2.0 in order toenforce the consideration obstacles within a radius of 2.0*min_obstacle_dist. [This parameter is used only if parameter legacy_obstacle_association is false]
  # obstacle_association_force_inclusion_factor: 1.5
  # # See obstacle_association_force_inclusion_factor, but beyond a multiple of [value]*min_obstacle_dist all obstacles are ignored during optimization.

  # no_inner_iterations: 5
  # # Each outerloop iteration automatically resizes the trajectory according to the desired temporal resolution dt_ref and invokes the internal optimizer (that performs no_inner_iterations). The total number of solver iterations in each planning cycle is therefore the product of both values.
